## Images

### Template
![Template](template.png)

PNG with transparency

### Frame
![Frame](frame.png)

Map taken from here <https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/#&gid=1&pid=4>

This is not the original image. It's a projection taken from a camera picture that is already processed to have perspective transformation and rescaling to the original map dimension.

We also have some shadows/reflections of lamps in my room.

### Camera Frame
![Camera Image](arctic_player_green_living_room.png)

Just for reference! We don't want to deal with this.

This is the master image where the frame image is taken from.

Matching here works :)
